# Movie_Recommendation_System_Deployment_using_Flask
When we watch videos on youtube we got some recommendations by the youtube likewise when we shop something on amazon we got some recommendations by the amazon. This process is done under Recommender System. Further it is divided into two types one is Content based filtering in which similar content is recommended another one is Collabrating filtering in which user ratings are considered for recommendation.
This model also works on Collabrating filtering in which Correlation is checked between user ratings of one particular movie with user ratings of all the other movies in the database, which means how a particular movie is correlated with other movie on the basis of ratings.
The service is being hosted on web using flask.Please check the user_guide file and try by your own
